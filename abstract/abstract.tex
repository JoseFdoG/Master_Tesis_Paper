In this master thesis, we discuss the factors that constitute difficulty. We first show the importance of difficulty, explaining the link between the challenges in video games with the playerâ€™s performance, learning, attention, and skills. We then report about what difficulty factors we wish to include in our research and why showing some examples of how to evaluate these factors and analyze their results. We argue that the analysis is limited if it does not consider difficulty from the human player's point of view. We provide a player and Game Design-oriented definition of the challenge and difficulty notions in games. Finally, we talk about the next steps in this field.
