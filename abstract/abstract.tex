In this master thesis, we discuss the factors that constitute difficulty into the video games field, a field really concurrent of studies in the last few years. Fields like teaching, or therapeutic purposes or even to validate the response to perform different tasks, however, the field that we want to study as the difficulty has not been explored much and in the investments in which the terminology has explored the difficulty in video games, they explored in a very general way. \cite{MartnezPlumed2017AIRF}

We first show the importance of difficulty, explaining the link between the challenges in video games with the playerâ€™s performance, learning, attention, and skills. We then report about what difficulty factors we wish to include in our research and why showing some examples of how to evaluate these factors and analyze their results. We argue that the analysis is limited if it does not consider difficulty from the human player's point of view. We provide a player and Game Design-oriented definition of the challenge and difficulty notions in games. Finally, we talk about the next steps in this field such as the study of other factors unrelated to those we will study in this research and the use of AI and how this affects the difficulty in video games, including what difficulty factors can be helpful for learning purposes.
